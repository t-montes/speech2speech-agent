# Speech-to-Speech Agent

First install [ffmpeg](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/ffmpeg-windows) and then run the following commands:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python agent.py
```

The agent will listen to your voice and simulate a call through the console, only talk when it says 'Recording...' on the screen.
